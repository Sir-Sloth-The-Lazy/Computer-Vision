## 🚀 The Roadmap

This repository is structured as a conceptual journey through the field of CV. Whether you're starting with pixels or prompting VLMs, you'll find it here.

### 🥉 Phase 1: The Foundations (Classical)

Understanding the basics of image representation and simple classification.

- **Linear Neural Networks**: The humble beginnings of image processing.
- **Shallow Architectures**: Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for basic pattern recognition.
- **Feature Engineering**: The era before deep learning took over.

### 🥈 Phase 2: The CNN Era (Deep Learning Dominance)

Exploring the power of spatial hierarchies and convolutional kernels.

- **Classic CNNs**: LeNet, AlexNet, VGG.
- **Residual Connections**: ResNets and the art of training deep networks.
- **Efficient Nets**: Balancing performance and compute (MobileNet, EfficientNet).

### 🥇 Phase 3: The Transformer Revolution

When Attention became the only thing you needed.

- **Vision Transformers (ViTs)**: Breaking images into patches.
- **Swin Transformers**: Hierarchical vision transformers via shifted windows.
- **Tokenization**: Reaching SOTA without convolutions.

### 🌌 Phase 4: The New Frontier (VLMs & Generative)

The intersection of Vision and Language.

- **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**: CLIP, ALIGN, and zero-shot capabilities.
- **Multi-modal Giants**: Integrating vision into LLMs (LLaVA, MiniGPT-4).
- **Generative CV**: Diffusion models and visual creation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch.
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, PIL, Scikit-Image, Matplotlib.
- **Optimization**: Weights & Biases for experiment tracking.
